# AWS Storage Core

## On-Premises Storage versus AWS Cloud Storage

For many organizations, moving to the cloud starts with an assessment of their existing on-premises storage infrastructure. Organizations that take the time to identify where and how their data is stored, have a head start in moving their existing workloads to the AWS Cloud. As you explore the available AWS Storage services, you can compare the storage service offerings to your on-premises storage infrastructure. 

In this lesson, you will learn to compare existing on-premises storage with AWS Storage service options and effectively assess your existing storage infrastructure. You will learn to identify patterns for diverse application and workload needs.

## Why organizations move to the cloud

Moving storage workloads to the cloud has been one of the main ways chief information officers (CIOs) can address their top strategic priorities:

## Increase Organization Agility

###  On-premises storage agility challenges

-   Resources are required to make changes to on-premises storage infrastructure. Resources include time, personnel, data center space and infrastructure, and fixed and variable costs. Capacity planning, resource planning, and budgeting are required before you can implement changes. As a result, the time to implement changes can be delayed from weeks to months or even years. 

-   Even after approval, it can take weeks or months to order, receive, and install new systems or additional capacity for existing ones. Many organizations offer provision storage capacity to deal with implementation and budgeting delays. The unused capacity consumes space and costly resources while waiting to be used.

-   On-premises storage infrastructure lacks the option to quickly reduce or change environments as your organization's needs change. After your storage is in place, it usually remains in place regardless of its use. Being able to re-allocate storage capacity from one storage silo or system to another silo or system is seldom possible. Most storage systems do not have the compatibility required for cross-system integration.

### Storage agility in AWS

#### AWS Storage services provide solutions to address the on-premises storage agility challenges. When using AWS Storage services, you can quickly change existing storage services or implement new ones.

-   AWS manages the required resources for you. You do not need to allocate time, implementation and management personnel, data center space and infrastructure, or use fixed and variable costs to change your storage infrastructure. You manage how you use the storage services that you provision.

-   You have access to virtually unlimited storage capacity when you need it. You can add storage capacity on demand without over-provisioning capacity.

-   You can reduce capacity or discontinue use of a storage service at any time. Your storage service use is not restrained by physical system limitations. 

-   With AWS services, you can move data between different storage silos or systems as needed. After copying your data to a different service, you can delete the source service, or delete the data from the service to save money. 

## Accelerate ablility to innovate

-   To innovate, you must be able to develop and test new workflows on demand. For example, a test and development environment must be flexible to try different designs and workflows and then make changes as needed. You must often scale the development environment for testing. Conversely, you must also be able to abandon an environment after testing is completed, or abandon any temporary environments when no longer needed.  

-   To innovate with on-premises storage systems, you need to purchase new systems or use unused capacity on existing systems. Purchasing new systems takes time and resources. Using existing systems can present challenges with available capacity or having the correct type of resource required.

-   With on-premises storage systems, often the data is contained in separate storage systems that create silos that are disconnected from each other. The separation makes it difficult to access the systems to perform analytics or use machine learning across systems.

-   With AWS Storage, you can start development on one service and experiment using different services to meet your workflow's requirements. You can increase or reduce capacity as needed for your development and testing environment. Using AWS Storage services provides you a flexible environment for innovation.

## Strengthen Security 

### On-premises storage and network infrastructure are often not uniformly secured from external or internal access. Security concerns include:

-   Physical security access to storage systems

-   Consistent encryption for data at rest and data in transit

-   Appropriate user, group, and role access controls

-   External network attacks or system hacking

### Organizations can improve their security posture as they gain insights by removing data silos and improving encryption controls. With AWS, you inherit all of the controls, tools, best practices, and certifications designed for even the most security-conscious organizations. 

### Cloud providers secure the cloud infrastructure and separate the infrastructure from the customer applications. The benefit is you no longer need to be concerned about infrastructure security.

## Reduce Costs

-   With cloud storage, you do not have to purchase hardware, provision storage, or provide capital for "someday" scenarios. You can add or remove capacity on demand, quickly change performance and retention characteristics, and pay only for storage that you actually use. You can move less frequently accessed data automatically to lower-cost tiers in accordance with auditable rules. This flexibility drives economies of scale. 

## Operational expense versus capital investment

-   A benefit of moving to the cloud is shifting expenses from fixed or variable costs to ongoing costs. Instead of paying for system and software expenses up front and then realizing the expenses over time, cloud services are charged as a monthly expense. This reduces budgeting and ordering fulfillment cycles and realizes the expenses when they occur.

### Cloud storage is typically purchased from a third-party cloud vendor that owns and operates data storage capacity and delivers it over the internet in a pay-as-you-go model. These cloud storage vendors manage capacity, security, and durability to make data accessible to your applications all around the world.

### Applications access cloud storage through traditional storage protocols or directly through an API. Many vendors offer complementary services designed to help collect, manage, secure, and analyze data at massive scale.



### Cloud storage is a reliable, scalable, and secure place for your data. AWS offers a complete range of services for you to store, access, govern, and analyze your data to reduce costs, increase agility, and accelerate innovation. You donâ€™t have to perform a one-to-one replacement of your on-premises storage (also known as lift and shift). Instead, you can re-platform or re-architect your storage to optimize cost, manageability, and performance based on your applications needs.
